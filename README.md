IMPACT-OF-THE-COVID-19-PANDEMIC-ON-SPORTS
COVID-19 is a droplet-transmitted potentially fatal coronavirus pandemic
affecting the world in 2020. The WHO recommended social distance and
human-to-human contact was discouraged to control the transmission. It has put
many countries in a state of lockdown and many sporting events (including the
2020 Olympics) have been affected. Participation in sports and exercise, typically
regarded as healthy activities, were also debated. Many of the sports have been
cancelled and postponed due to more increasing rate of COVID-19 also some
matches have been held with no spectators on the grounds playing by only with
players without spectators.Large spectating crowds are well-known to be
infectious hazards, but the infection risk for on-field players is less recognized.
Aside from watching professionals exercise, many people opted to hike in the
countryside during the weekends to avoid city crowds. This led to a widespread
discussion on the issue of wearing a facemask during outdoor activities.
